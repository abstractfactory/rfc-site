# Goal

1. A problem
2. An understanding of the problem
3. A solution
4. An understanding of the solution

# Information is abstract

files, folders, ones and zeros

# Data Modeling

* eye distills content into lines
* map represents complex geometric information
= data modeling is essential.

What differentiates us

* We start from artists, looking towards technicalities.
* Others start from technicalities, looking towards artists.

Without artists, we need not exist. Artists define us and our work. What doesn't work for an artist, doesn't work at all.

### Values

Built on extreme programming practices

* rapid feedback
* trust
* 

Artists want: (what)

* technology to stay out of their way. (less options, less complexity)
* direct access to the information the contribute to. (peer work and progress; e.g. dailies introspection)
* live updates on how their contributions influence the big picture. (proceduralism) (rapid feedback)
* readily available knowledge (knowledge-base, asset libraries)
* instant access to colleagues (notifications, information-streams, transmissions)
* transparent access to information (integrations, self-describing content)

How?

* and agile deveoplment style (iterate, collaborate, over following a plan)
* lean values and methods (no waste)
* non-atomicity/partial outputs

What?

* Pipi

Database in content creation is "a tractor on auto-bahn". Powerful and specialised for a purpose.

Database in content creation is "a sportscar in the woods". Powerful and specialised for a purpose.

A terrain vehicle on auto-bahn.

### Preamble

The relational database is the primary vehicle for metadata in visual effects. (dare I say in digital content creation overall?). The relational database is designed for storage and retrieval of large amounts of static, uniform and small data in a very short amount of time.

Conversely, content creation favours infrequently accessed, heterogenous, sparse and large data.

### Metaphor

The use of a database in content creation is similar to the use of supercars for jungle tracking; i.e. use of specialised vehicles for a specialised task, where the glove does not fit the foot. What you need is a terrain vehicle; robust, resilient, responding to change. What you need is Open Metadata.

Atomicity: Each step in the sequence of actions performed within the boundaries of a transaction mu complete successfully or all work must roll back. Partial completion is not a transactional concept. Thus, if Martin is transferring some money from his savings to his checking account and the server crashes after he's withdrawn the money from his savings, the system behaves as if he never did the withdrawal. Committing says both things occurred; a roll back says neither occurred. It has to or neith
