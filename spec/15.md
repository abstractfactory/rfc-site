# Goal

It may sometimes be necessary to assign meta-data to meta-data itself; for example, the `group.list` type represents a physical folder on disk with the suffix ".list"

```python
- personal.list
  +-- firstname.string
  +-- lastname.string
  +-- age.int
```

Generic meta-metadata

* `readonly`
* `hidden`
* `permissions`

Lists are naturally ordered, but how can we store this order on disk together with the datasets it may contain?

# Architecture

One way would be to introduce a header into each of the files.

```python
firstname.string = r'Marcus\norder=0'
```

This could potentially be appropriate in many situations, but would in this case introduce possibility of conflicting ordering. 

```python
firstname.string = r'Marcus\norder=2'
lastname.string = r'Ottosson\norder=2'
```

So an alternative may be to store this information in a specially formatted dataset pertaining to the information at hand.

```python
- personal.list
  +-- __order__
  +-- firstname.string
  +-- lastname.string
  +-- age.int
```

```python
__order__ = r'firstname=0\nlastname=1\nage=2'
```

In code, meta-meta-data could then be retrieved as such:

```python
>>> location = om.Location('/home/marcus')
>>> firstname = location.read('/personal/firstname')
>>> type(firstname)
<type 'Dataset'>
>>> firstname.order
0
```

Each meta-meta-data dataset or group MAY be accessible via dot-notation syntax by languages that support it and MUST otherwise be accessible via other means.

If a dataset is not included in `__order__` then a null value MUST be returned. If the host group does not contain a `__order__` meta-meta-data set then an error MUST be raised.

### Ordering

Meta-metadata MUST appear *after* the `value` so that `value` may be retrieved without regard to meta-metadata in a streaming fashion.
