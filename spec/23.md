# What is Digital Content Creation?

Well, first of all the word 'content' is loosely defined. 'Content' within the context of Pipi simply means 'data', but I fear even that suffers from a rather loose definition.

Let's just all agree that we are talking about bringing something into existance that previously did not exist. 'Digital' content creation then is the bringing of something into existance happening digitally; i.e. in the form of ones and zeroes.

Whenever you bring anything into existance that exists purely as ones and zeroes, you are digitally creating content and that is where Pipi is made to fit.

# What is a platform?

Google defines 'platform' as 

> an essential supporting structure of a building, vehicle, or object.

In terms of software development, this means a supporting structure to your software. Which means Pipi isn't an application on its own but rather relies on you making it into one.

This isn't true, of course. Not fully, at least. It is a framework with "batteries-included"; meaning you can take it for a spin without any programming knowledge. But for those of you that do have programming knowledge, there is an equal amount of pleasantries in there for you as well.

Pipi ships with solutions to most common problems in any domain where something is being brought into existance by means of computers. This applies to making film, making games, making music and more.
