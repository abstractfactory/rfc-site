### Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System (COSS)][].

### Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

### Goal

To establish that Frameworks, Methods and Processes are the only three categories fit for any problem faced in the creation of Content.

### Definition

1. A framework provides guidelines. It exists to provide structure and direction on a preferred way of doing something without being too detailed or rigid. Programming languages are analagous to frameworks.

2. A method is a body of techniques; a limited and further distilled Framework which typically serve to solve specific problems. Applications are analagous to methods.

3. A process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end. It is the lowest-level of performing a task and may be broken down into two or more processes; this is known as [Divide and Conquer][]
