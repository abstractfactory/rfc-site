# Goal


### Event Propagation

An event generated by a child MUST propagate to its parent; and so on so forth until there are no more parents left.

### Multiple observers

One significant difference between `Signal` and `Request` is that `Request` supports multiple inputs. Multiple observers may contribute to the return value of a given request; the first one to return an appropriate response wins.

In the majority of cases, a request will have 0-1 observers.
