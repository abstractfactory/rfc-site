# Goal

In high-concurrency situations file-writing runs the risk of being written to simultaneously from multiple sources. This document then describes a few ways in which this may be dealt with while still retaining the flexibility and generality of Open Metadata itself.

ZMO MUST remain compatible with both RFC10 (Open Metadata) and RFC11 (OOM).
