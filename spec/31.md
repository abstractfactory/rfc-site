# The Four Pillars of Configurable Content

# Goal

To enable a logical separation of all content imaginable into four distinct layers; `private`, `public`, `appdata` and `userdata`.

Digital content creation pipelines are all about `data`. `data` crafted by `users` in various `applications`. In such an environment, `data` is either `private` to each `user` or `public` and discoverable to all. Configuration of `applications` is referred to as `appdata` and per-user configuration as `userdata`.

For further definition of `private` versus `public`, head over to RFC9.
