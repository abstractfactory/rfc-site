# Goal

Pipi is:

* Location agnostic
* Software agnostic
* Platform agnostic
* Scale agnostic

And our mantra is "Enable Artists"; opposite of which is "Constraining Artists"

### Location Agnostic

Location agnosticism referes to your production environment not being bound by your physical location. Pipi isn't built for today, but for tomorrow, and thus this requirement is based on my prediction that outsourcing will become much more prevalent in the future.

Outsourcing doesn't necessarily mean shipping parts of your work to India or China, but may also refer to you yourself working from home; what is ultimately required is work internal to your company requiring remote access.

Once you start heading down this route, you realise that there are a few things to consider for a water-proof workflow.

* Transferring
* Receiving
* Synchronising

# FAQ

Q: About your "Enable Artists" mantra; what about the argument that giving artists too much freedom might run the risk of causing disorder, rather than order, in a collaborative environment? And without a strict, "one-way of doing things" mindset, artists would ultimately end up confused and not know what to do?

A: This is important and something we recommend; a studio should definitely enforce one way of working and ensure artists understand why and how things are done the way that they are. Our mantra, "Enable Artists" is in relation to Pipi, not your pipeline. You build a pipeline using Pipi and it is up to you to put in the constraints required to make your artists happy; that is not something we will attempt to do for you.

We may suggest one way for you to apply Pipi - we do of course have ideal candidates for usage and work-flow, all of which is openly shared with you in our RFC repository of methodologies and specifications - but at the end of the day we provide a non-restrictive platform that allows you to make your own assumptions and specify your own requirements based on what fits your situation the best. It would be foolish of us to try and impose our way of thinking onto you and your situation, as we could not begin to assume how this situation would look. Hence "Enable Artists" is something enforced here at Abstract Factory, but not necessarily something enforced at your studio.
