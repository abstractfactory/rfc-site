# Goal

As content is strongly-coupled to the application in which it was produced, it can sometimes be beneficial to maintain multiple data-types of the same version so as to allow it to be used in multiple applications other than the one it was originally created in.

Representations Pattern define a way in which to do so with little logical overhead.
