# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System (COSS)][].

# Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

# Goal

Inheritance is a mechanism often employed in Object-Oriented programming practices to promote code reuse.

In the Abstract Factory RFC, inheritance plays a similar role and lay grounds for a hierarchy in which children may infer content via its parent.

# Architecture

Specifications provide a `inherits` and an optional `inherited by` property specifying from where to inherit content.

# Example

* Name: https://github.com/abstract-factory/rfc/spec:3 (3/MVP)
* Editor: Marcus Ottosson <marcus@abstractfactory.io>
* Inherits: spec:2
* Inherited by: spec:3, 

Here, [spec:3][] inherits from [spec:2][] meaning [spec:3][] includes content specified by [spec:2][] - including copyright notice, change process and language - on a header-by-header notice.

Furthermore, an inherited specification provides the interface for which to design descendant specifications.
