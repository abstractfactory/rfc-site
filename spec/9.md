# Goal

When working towards a goal, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between what is presentable and what is work-in-progress; resulting in inconsistency in the manner in which results are ultimately presented to others.

# Architecture

When creating content, there are exactly two types of results; `private` and `public` 

* `private`: work-in-progress or in-development style results not relevant to others but merely a preamble to `public` results.
* `public`: results conformed to a set of standards so as to provide a consistent service for others.

In a sense, private results reside at the back of a craftsman's shop; rough, unpolished and nonsensical to the untrained eye. Public results however fully encapsulates its value and worth in a form easily digestible to others; so as to attract as many as possible.
