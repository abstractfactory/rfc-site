# Goal

In jewellery, craftsmen shape metals to fit a pre-determined design. 

Crafting takes place in an environment with access to tools and space to move; i.e. the `workbench`. Once crafted, the piece is processed until ready for public display; i.e. for the `shopfront`.

This is applicable to content creation as a whole.

Here, an artist crafts content using tools he knows; i.e. at the `workbench`. However the content isn't ready for public display; perhaps it resides within the native format of esoteric software and needs conversion before it can become useful in another context; i.e. it must be processed before being put into a `shopfront`.

To qualify for a `shopfront`, content is carefully processed to the point where nothing can be removed nor added without losing its essence; i.e. until it has become minimally complete.

The `workbench` in this example is the `private` aspect of content creation, whereas the `shopfront` represents the `public` view.

* `workbench` - `private`
* `shopfront` - `public`

# Aliases

The pattern is common, but may have resided under a different alias.

`private` is sometimes also referred to as

* `dev`
* `wip`
* `user`
* `private`
* `work`
* `source`

`public` is sometimes also referred to as

* `pub`
* `published`
* `production`
* `build`
