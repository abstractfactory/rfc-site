# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Goal

Open Metadata is plain and verbose. By storing geometry in such a way opens up doors beyond traditional use and may help educate or inspire further analysis of what it takes to serialise geometric primitives into plain data.

# Architecture

* `points`
* `edges`
* `faces`
* `cache` = multiple `points`?
* `points` = multiple `point`

3d geometry is defined by a set of points, connected by edges, connected by faces. Moving geometry then is defined by the same three (3) collections, with additional points.
