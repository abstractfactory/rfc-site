# Goal

Open Metadata supports a variety of data-types that are directly editable via the API. However some data-types are inevitably going to become part of a metadata hierarchy that Open Metadata will have no knowledge of and will be unable to edit.

* `jpeg`
* `png`
* `mov`
* `alembic`
* `obj`
* `...`
