# Goal

Distribute task(s) to worker(s). To utilise the total sum of available resources whilst ensuring a minimal loss of resources.

Ground rules:

* GRU01: Client may independently assert required resources
* GRU02: Worker may independently assert available resources
* GRU03: Worker may process multiple requests simultaneously
