# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Goal

The goal of the Polylithic Versioning Pattern is to maximise control whilst minimising the rate of error at the cost of additional steps required in keeping a hierarchy of tasks up to date.

# Architecture

Polylithic Versioning, also known as Immutable Versioning, is the act of incrementally saving DOCUMENT; each increment providing `state` to said DOCUMENT.

As opposed to [Monolithic Versioning][] ([RFC3](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/3)), changes are made `explicit` and require manual intervention when it comes time to perform an `update`.
