# Frequently Asked Questions

> What is the difference between Pipi and Shotgun/FTrack/Tactic/5th Kind?

I suppose one way of summarising their differences is this - Shotgun et. al. connects *people*, Pipi connects *software*. They're actually solving a different set of problems - Shotgun et. al. are for production; i.e. keeping track of artists and their tasks and ensuring the project is on track - and they do it really well. Pipi on the other hand is concerned with tracking data as it passes through software and the process of distilling and reconstituting data so as to facilitate change throghout the project. At the end of the day, they both need each other.

> Is Pipi running in the cloud?

Pipi is where the work is. At the moment, our target audience work locally so locally is where it needs to be. This is one of the issues with cloud-based solutions; they are too far (relative to Pipi) away from many of the problems they have started solving recently i.e. software integrations. Because they are so far away (i.e. in the cloud) you get ultimately struggle with latency on anything that relies on communicating with the pipeline.

> How is the current user resolved?

By looking at your user account. The idea is that one identity is enough; with your user account you've already got Google setup, your chat program and mail client. We're there too.

> How do I install Pipi?

Pipi is mainly Python and would initially be installed somewhere central. This location would then be added to each additional computer's PYTHONPATH and viola; Pipi is accessible from (i.e. is "installed on") all your computers.

> About your "Enable Artists" mantra; what is your thoughts about giving artists too much freedom might run the risk of causing disorder, rather than order, in a collaborative environment? And without a strict, "one-way of doing things" mindset, artists would ultimately end up confused and not know what to do?

This is important; a studio should definitely enforce a particular way of working and ensure artists understand why and how things are done the way that they are. Our mantra, "Enable Artists" is in relation to the Pipi framework, not your work ethics. You build your pipeline using Pipi as a tool and it is up to you to put in the constraints required to make your artists happy; that is not something we will attempt to do for you.

Having said that, we may *suggest* one way in which to apply Pipi - we do of course have ideal candidates for usage and workflow, all of which is openly shared with you in our [RFC repository][] of methodologies and specifications - but at the end of the day we provide a non-restrictive platform that allows you to make your own assumptions and specify your own requirements based on what fits your situation the best. It would be foolish of us to try and impose our way of thinking onto you and your situation, as we could not begin to assume how this situation would look. Hence "Enable Artists" is something enforced here at Abstract Factory, but not necessarily something enforced at your studio.
