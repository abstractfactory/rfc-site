# Timed Versioning Pattern

This document describes a compromise between Immutable and Mutable Versioning, called Timed Versioning.

# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Goals

TVP implements an implicit system of version control which allows for referencing past states via the use of time-stamps.

The problems imposed by IVP is the manual intervention involved in updates. MVP fixes this, but removes our ability to refer to arbitrary points in history.

As a compromise, TVP stores history exactly like IVP but allows artists to instead refer to an additional single monolithic version that is constantly kept at the highest, or recommended, version.

# Definition

* Transitioning between versions MUST NOT require manual intervention.
* Referring to past, present and future states MUST be explicit.

# Architecture

Versions may be classified as being either `historical` or `current`. Furthermore, states may be classified as being either `latest` or `recommended` and `historical` versions MUST include a `timestamp`

* `historical`: persistent and immutable, just like IVP, and MUST include a `timestamp`
* `current`: a singleton and the one referred to by others and is continually replaced to reflect either `latest` or `recommended` states.
* `latest`: last state at which a product was saved.
* `recommended`: human-decided factors govern whether or not a version is recommended or not (usually those backwards-compatible with previous versions or those representing the next evolutionary step (e.g. an upgrade))
* `timestamp`: a unique point in time with precision appropriate for the given application. (suggested year:month:day:hour:minute for long-running projects and month:day:hour:minute:second for shorter ones)

# Reference Implementation

The `current` version MUST be allowed to take any form and `historical` versions MUST include a `timestamp`

* `name`
* `name:separator:timestamp`

Where `name`, like in IVP, is a short human-readable identifier and `timestamp` a unique identifier for the time at which the product was made.

* `/product/myAsset`
* `/product/history/myAsset_1403251846`

Products referencing `myAsset` MUST include a `timestamp` at which the reference took place.

* `/otherproduct/myProject`
