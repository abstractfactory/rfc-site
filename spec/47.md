# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Goal

Duplicity is the one thing hindering knowledge finding those who seek answers. Like markdown has simplified the art of writing and formatting, make HQL simplify the art of asking in such a way that similar questions are more easily found and merged into answers that can then be expanded/generalised to fit the broader question.
