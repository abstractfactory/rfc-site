# MVP - Monolithic Versioning for Production

In contrast to [spec:2 - Immutable Versioning for Production][], Mutable Versioning for Production disregards layers and favours a monolithic appraoch to tracking change.

# Goals

TVP implements an implicit system of version control without manual intervention when transitioning between versions.

This is in direct contrast of IVP whose purpose is to enforce that each change remains separate and layered and therefore non-destructive.

The differences may be considered explicit versus implicit; where explicit change facilitates tracking and control wheras implicit facilitates faster turn-around times.

The goals of TVP are to:
* Simplify the process of maintaining updates of content.
* Simplify the process of transitioning between updates to content.

# Definition

* Transitioning between versions MUST NOT require manual intervention.

# Reference Implementation

Versioning MUST be allowed to take any form and MUST NOT be restricted to any schema.

`name`

Where `name`, like in IVP, is a short identifier for the product in development.

`myAsset`
