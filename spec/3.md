# Monolithic Versioning for Production

This document describes a method of tracking change with a single document.

* Name: http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/3
* Editor: Marcus Ottosson <marcus@abstractfactory.io>
* Tags: versioning
* Related: [RFC2](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/2), [RFC4](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/4), [RFC33](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/33)
* State: draft

Copyright and Language can be found in [RFC1](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/1)

# Change Process

This document is governed by the [Consensus-Oriented Specification System](http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/COSS) (COSS).

# Language

In addition to the language defined in [RFC1](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/1), DOCUMENT refers to any digital content, including but not limited to files and folders.

# Goal

The goal of Monolithic Versioning is to maximise concurrency whilst minimising the amount of manual intervention required in keeping a hierarchy of tasks up to date at the cost of an implicit system with the potential to cause unwanted side-effects.

# Architecture

Monolithic Versioning, also known as Mutable Versioning, is the act of saving DOCUMENT whilst (optionally) maintaining history somewhere external to said DOCUMENT. Examples include systems such as [Git][], [Subversion][] and [Perforce][].

As opposed to [Polylithic Versioning][] ([RFC2](http://rfc.abstractfactory.io/spec/2)), changes are `implicit` and require no intervention on the part of the user when it comes to performing an `update`.
