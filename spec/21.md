# Goal

Software discovery is the process of finding software via reference; either absolute or relative.

```python
# Absolute reference
c:\program files\adobe\photoshop\ps.exe

# Relative reference
photoshop
```

```
metasoftware 	-- Software running other software
reference 		-- Handle to software
	relative 	-- relative_path.exe
	absolute 	-- c:\absolute\path.exe
	explicit 	-- c:\explicit\path.exe
	implicit 	-- implicit = "c:\path.exe"
```

<div class="pull-right">
metasoftware 	-- Software running other software
reference 		-- Handle to software
	relative 	-- relative_path.exe
	absolute 	-- c:\absolute\path.exe
	explicit 	-- c:\explicit\path.exe
	implicit 	-- implicit = "c:\path.exe"
</div>

References may in turn be either explicit or implicit. Implicit references are built into the software whereas explicit references are located external to the software.

Consider to `Microsoft Windows Add/Remove` application. Windows is shipped with a registry into which new software registers their presence upon installation. The `Add/Remove` application utilises this registry to *discover* which software is available on your system.

In this scenario, the `Windows Registry` is the `storage back-end` used for persistent explicit references, however this could be anything.

Windows registers software as part of their normal installation procedure. However there are cases in which you require control over this process. In which the `storage back-end` is not populated by third-party software such as Windows, but by you. One example of this is in metasoftware such as [Application Launchers][].

An Application Launcher, as defined on Wikipedia is..

> ..a computer program that helps a user to locate and start other computer programs.

Further down the rabbit-hole, there are cases in which metasoftware is usefully pre-loaded with available options as per a system-administrator's specifications; one example of this is in a Toolchain-centric environment (more on Content Creation Toolchains in RFC30).

`Production Studio X` runs:

* `Software X` version `1`
* `Software Y` version `3`
* `Software Z` version `6`

Within a toolchain, we would like multiple users to run the same software on multiple workstation with an identical set of available choices. Because the environemnt differs per workstation, we are forced to rely on using `relative` references as opposed to `absolute` since we cannot guarantee that the target of each `absolute` reference is valid across workstations.

Consider the reference 'maya'

```python
# Marcus computer
c:\program files\maya\maya.exe

# Bob's computer
/home/marcus/maya/maya.sh
```

# Architecture

```python
  __________ 
 |          |
 | criteria |
 |__________|
      |
      |
  ____v_____         ___________         __________
 |          |       |           |       |          |
 | launcher |------>| reference |------>| software |
 |__________|       |___________|       |__________|

```

Given a `criteria`, the `launcher` presents avaiable `software` via a set of `references`.

For our discussion, our criteria is `Pulp` - a digital asset used in a fictional game that I just made up. `Pulp` is made using the latest version of `Software X` and a rather old but trusty version of `Software Y`, these are our references.

As `launcher` will run on multiple computers, on multiple platforms in multiple locations at various times, we can't be sure of where `Software X` is located; whether it is located locally on the file-system, or maybe it's a web-application running off the cloud and drawn in your browser. Either way, our `launcher` can't make any assumptions about it.

For the sake of discussion, our criteria will come from disk and will have been put there by humans.

```python
+-- project
|   +-- game
|   |   +-- Pulp
```

The next step is to store references in a way that makes them accessible via `Pulp`. One way is to store them in a text document somewhere.

```python
# my_references.txt
/project/game/pulp
    Software X
    Software Y
```

We can trim this file by storing it directly within `Pulp`

```python
# references.txt
Software X
Software Y
```

### Method 2 - Generating paths


### Method 3 - Meeting half-way
