# Goal

* nodes either point towards another node, their reverse relationship thus being implied via context. 
* disadvantage of this is, in a large network, it may take some time for this implied data to get computer.
* disadvantage of keeping a link alive on both ends is their potential to mis-fire and otherwise get out of sync.
